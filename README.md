# Role of Environmental flows and flooding on floodplain nutrient subsidies and nutrient dynamics 

This respository will serve as a central location to house information for ongoing synthesis efforts associated with understanding river floodplain nutrient dynamics and nutrient stoichiometry within floodplain ecosystems. 

Project specific documents including author agreements, rules, rules of conduct and necessary white-papers and technical publications will be housed in this repository. __This repository will not post data unless authorized by data provider.__
